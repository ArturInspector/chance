# Axioms of the "Chance" Project

Axioms are fundamental statements that we accept without proof. The entire system is built on them. If even one axiom is false, the entire system collapses.

## 1. Agency

A person can perform actions that change reality.
```
If you can't do anything (complete determinism), this system is not for you. But since you're reading and thinking about this—you are an agent. Actions have consequences.
```

## 2. Measurability

```
Any action produces observable feedback.
```

There are no actions without consequences. Feedback may be delayed (months later), noisy (many factors), but it exists. Without measurement, there is no control.

## 3. Decomposability

```
Any complex action can be broken down into atomic steps.
```

There is no magic. "Become a programmer" = a thousand specific actions (write a function, solve a problem, read a chapter). Everything can be broken down to "what exactly you do with your hands."

## 4. Resource Limitations

```
Time, energy, attention, money—always finite.
```

You can't do everything. Every action has a cost. Every choice excludes other options. Prioritization is not an option, but a necessity.

## 5. Subjectivity of Observation

```
Objective reality is inaccessible. You see your interpretation.
```

"I wrote a function"—this is your interpretation. Maybe the code is bad. Maybe it doesn't solve the right thing. Complete objectivity is impossible. Calibration through external feedback is the only path to approximation.

## 6. Unverifiability of Plans

```
The correctness of a plan can only be known after execution.
```

A plan is a hypothesis, not a guarantee. Hidden conditions only emerge in practice. "I'm doing everything right, but muscle mass isn't growing" → somewhere there's an error in the assumptions (sleep, stress, genetics). Iterative correction is mandatory.

## 7. Homeostasis

```
The system (brain, body) resists change.
```

New things are expensive. Adaptation cost >> base cost. The brain won't let you do 10 new procedures at once—you'll consume the entire energy budget. Habituation reduces resistance, but requires time (~21 days).

## 8. Incompleteness of Self-Knowledge

```
You cannot detect all your errors from within.
```

Parasitic goals are invisible to you. Cognitive biases are blind spots. Gödel's theorem for life: a system with errors cannot see all its errors. External references (people, formal criteria, data) are mandatory.

## 9. Delayed Feedback

```
Results come with delay. Sometimes significant.
```

Code—minutes. Product—weeks. Health—months. Reputation—years. The longer the feedback loop, the higher the risk. Leading indicators (leading metrics) are critical for long-term goals.

## 10. Uncertainty of the Future

```
The future is unpredictable. Even with a perfect plan.
```

The world is chaotic. External factors are uncontrollable. Black swans happen. Flexibility and the ability to adapt are more important than the accuracy of the initial plan.

## What Follows from This

If you accept all 10 axioms, the following theorems apply:
- Procedural achievability (math.md)
- Detection of parasitic goals (parasitic-goals.md)
- Measurement of dependencies (dependency-measure.md)
- Four fundamental problems (problems/)

If even one axiom doesn't fit—the system won't work. Check.
